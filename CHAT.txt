1. Agastya-I got 3 main method for dealing with bad requests: 1. The main method- "What the f*ck is wrong with you?" 2. My method- "GET SOME HELP!" 3. A method suggested by my graduating elder sister- "We will not allow this prompt. The police are approaching rapidly." What should we use?
Hey i'm sorry about yesterday i don't check my messages or notifications
Agastya- yeah no problem. specify who you are though, as this could be bad if there are more than 2 people in the future. also don't touch my database, and vote on what we should do. What should we do?
Agastya- Also, We need to get more people involved. also private the database. I'll make a new file for the rules of Chat.txt.
